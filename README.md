## Project Description

### Problem Definition & Purpose
<!-- 1. What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?
2. Identify the problem youâ€™re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving? -->
The initial purpose of Bookly arose when the development team observed the lack of localised and dedicated platforms on which students could exchange their textbooks. Many competitors who dominate the marketplace sphere often fail to tailor their products to student needs. The resulting product is often a convoluted and unintuitive website for students. While failing to understand their key demographic and charging disproportionately high fees, a void was created in the marketplace. It was because of this demand for a student-centric textbook marketplace that Bookly was created.

During the development process, the team came to fully grasp the generic and modular nature of the application design. By a unanimous vote, it was decided that the application be tailored to the general public selling books of all kinds.

Starting from its humble beginnings, targeting students, the development team of Bookly eventually recognised that everyone could benefit from a book-specific marketplace that operates on a no/low-fee model. Business models behind the dominating marketplaces have changed over time, many move to subscription-based services while others increase payment fees in order to fund other financial ventures. Whenever this business model shift occurs on an industry-wide level, there is a new drive in demand for simpler alternatives. Bookly fulfills this demand with a no-nonsense book exchange marketplace that does what it does best, provide a platform for those wishing to buy and sell books.

### Functionality & Features
<!-- 3. Describe the project you will be conducting and how your App will address the needs. -->
The driving influence and philosophy behind Bookly is to focus on one purpose and to excel at that purpose. A marketplace on which people can exchange books is simple in design but incredibly difficult to implement with many minor considerations that affect the user experience and overall quality of the product.

Contrasting with generic marketplaces, Bookly focuses on books and allows users to list books for sale or place an order with minimal impediments. A user need not spend more time than necessary in order to list a book as being for sale. Similarly, a user will find very few steps in between logging in to Bookly and placing an order for a book that they have just found. This straightforward implementation resolves any qualms that a user might have in navigating a more convoluted marketplace competitor in achieving the same objective as on Bookly.

### Instructions to Setup, Configure and Use the App

Installing Ruby:
1. Ensure Ruby is installed by entering the following command in Terminal: `ruby --version`
    - If a valid Ruby version is not returned, refer to the following link to install Ruby for your operating system: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

Downloading the Application:
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository as linked above; and
2. Either **clone** or **download ZIP** of the application.

Installing Gems:
1. Ensure you have **Bundler** installed by opening Terminal and entering the following command:  `bundler --version`
    - If Bundler is not installed and an error is returned, enter the following command to install: `gem install bundler`
2. Navigate to the root directory of the application and install the required gems with: `bundle install`

Database Setup:
1. Bookly's repository contains the default database configuration in `database.example.yml`.
2. Ensure your Terminal's path is in `/Bookly/config` and enter the following command to copy the contents of this default configuration into a separate file to be used by Rails: `cp database.example.yml database.yml`
3. If necessary, change the settings within `database.yml` to match the credentials of your PostgreSQL setup.

Running the Application on your localhost
1. Ensure you are in the application's root directory and enter the following command to run the application within your browswer: `rails server`
