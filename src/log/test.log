The author addresses the synthesis of the common law and statutory position to provide a very readable and accessible text that applies a logical and systematic approach to the introduction of each key topic. The easy-to-navigate design supports the clear discussion and analysis of statutory provisions and leading cases to engage readers. To consolidate understanding, each chapter provides a set of self-test questions and a problem question in each of the civil and criminal jurisdictions. This third edition includes a comparative discussion of the position under the Commonwealth Evidence Act 1995, which forms the foundation of the Uniform Evidence Acts regime, to promote familiarity with the evidence rules applicable to practice in federal matters. This book is an ideal introduction for students to the law of evidence and an excellent reference for Queensland legal practitioners."], ["image_link", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngP8oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"], ["authors", "David Field"]]

The author addresses the synthesis of the common law and statutory position to provide a very readable and accessible text that applies a logical and systematic approach to the introduction of each key topic. The easy-to-navigate design supports the clear discussion and analysis of statutory provisions and leading cases to engage readers. To consolidate understanding, each chapter provides a set of self-test questions and a problem question in each of the civil and criminal jurisdictions. This third edition includes a comparative discussion of the position under the Commonwealth Evidence Act 1995, which forms the foundation of the Uniform Evidence Acts regime, to promote familiarity with the evidence rules applicable to practice in federal matters. This book is an ideal introduction for students to the law of evidence and an excellent reference for Queensland legal practitioners."], ["image_link", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngP8oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"], ["authors", "David Field"]]

The author addresses the synthesis of the common law and statutory position to provide a very readable and accessible text that applies a logical and systematic approach to the introduction of each key topic. The easy-to-navigate design supports the clear discussion and analysis of statutory provisions and leading cases to engage readers. To consolidate understanding, each chapter provides a set of self-test questions and a problem question in each of the civil and criminal jurisdictions. This third edition includes a comparative discussion of the position under the Commonwealth Evidence Act 1995, which forms the foundation of the Uniform Evidence Acts regime, to promote familiarity with the evidence rules applicable to practice in federal matters. This book is an ideal introduction for students to the law of evidence and an excellent reference for Queensland legal practitioners."], ["image_link", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngP8oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"], ["authors", "David Field"]]

The author addresses the synthesis of the common law and statutory position to provide a very readable and accessible text that applies a logical and systematic approach to the introduction of each key topic. The easy-to-navigate design supports the clear discussion and analysis of statutory provisions and leading cases to engage readers. To consolidate understanding, each chapter provides a set of self-test questions and a problem question in each of the civil and criminal jurisdictions. This third edition includes a comparative discussion of the position under the Commonwealth Evidence Act 1995, which forms the foundation of the Uniform Evidence Acts regime, to promote familiarity with the evidence rules applicable to practice in federal matters. This book is an ideal introduction for students to the law of evidence and an excellent reference for Queensland legal practitioners."], ["image_link", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngP8oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"], ["authors", "David Field"]]

The author addresses the synthesis of the common law and statutory position to provide a very readable and accessible text that applies a logical and systematic approach to the introduction of each key topic. The easy-to-navigate design supports the clear discussion and analysis of statutory provisions and leading cases to engage readers. To consolidate understanding, each chapter provides a set of self-test questions and a problem question in each of the civil and criminal jurisdictions. This third edition includes a comparative discussion of the position under the Commonwealth Evidence Act 1995, which forms the foundation of the Uniform Evidence Acts regime, to promote familiarity with the evidence rules applicable to practice in federal matters. This book is an ideal introduction for students to the law of evidence and an excellent reference for Queensland legal practitioners."], ["image_link", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngP8oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"], ["authors", "David Field"]]
